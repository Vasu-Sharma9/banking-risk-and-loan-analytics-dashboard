# Banking Risk & Loan Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in banking and financial services, using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that help banks assess loan repayment likelihood and minimize financial loss. It analyzes client profiles, cleans data, calculates KPIs for loans, deposits, and risk, and visualizes insights for actionable decision-making.

### Core Problem Statement
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

### Solution
The dashboard enables banks to make data-driven decisions on loan approvals by instantly assessing the applicant’s profile against key risk indicators and financial history. It helps determine if an applicant is likely to repay a loan, thereby mitigating lending risk.

## Technical Stack & Data Model

* **Primary Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* **Modeling Language:** Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
* **Source Data:** Multiple interlinked tables including `Banking Relationship`, `Client-Banking`, `Gender`, `Investment Advisor`, and `Period`.

### Data Preparation Highlights

* **Income Band Creation:** Categorized clients into **Low** (`< 100,000`) and **Mid** (`< 300,000`) income bands to segment risk profiles.
* **Engagement Timeframe:** Calculated the duration (in `Engagment Days`) a client has been associated with the bank since their joining date.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Calculation / Definition |

## Future Enhancements

* **Investor Profiling:** Segmenting investors to understand the total loan amount across specific investor types.
* **Market Strategy:** Analyzing which type of banks (e.g., private) have more clients to help other banks build strategies to increase their client base.
* **Geographical Risk:** Providing insights about which nationality has the highest bank loans to assess foreign market exposure.
